    slug: "the-roman-gladiators-a-life-of-servitude-and-violence",
    content: `Gladiators, originating from the Latin word “gladius” or sword, stemmed from professional and amateur fighters in ancient Rome who fought for the entertainement of “civilized” spectators. Gladiators were trained in special schools called ludi which could be found as commonly as ampitheatres throughout the empire. There were four schools in Rome itself, the largest of which was called the Ludus Magnuswhich was connected to the Coliseum by an underground tunnel. Among the most famous is the school at Capua where the slave rebellion of Spartacus was sparked in 73 BC. Typically, like modern boxers, most gladiators would not fight more than 2 or 3 times a year and with enough fame and fortune they could purchase their freedom. Some, however, such as criminals, were either expected to die within a year, or might earn their release after three years, if they survived. Gladiator games, known as “ludi circenses”, took place in arenas of various sizes and prestige, throughout the empire. The ludi circenses, seen as a method to appease the Roman gods and avert Rome from disaster, were first fought in wooden arenas. The first stone built amphitheatre in Ancient Rome was the Amphitheater of Statilius Taurus (built in 29 BC), later to be followed by the Roman Colosseum, built in 80AD. The origin of the ludi circenses is rooted in the Estruscan custom of ritual human sacrifices to honor the dead. The first recorded gladiatorial fight took place in 264 BC, when three pairs of slaves were sel`,

    content: `One of the most fascinating aspects of modern day sword making, particularly in regards to medieval swords, is without question, Damascus steel. Time after time, collectors have asked us about the properties and the beautiful patterns for which Damascus steel is so well known for. Inevitably, as a collector, one is bound to be fascinated by the artistic attributes of Damascus steel blades. The complex range of possibilities in terms of color scheme, pattern designs and the contrast between various alloys used to create Damascus present some of the fascinating aspects of pattern-welding. The purpose of this brief introduction is to provide the novice sword collector, a basic understanding of the steps involved in forging Damascus steel such as our Elite Series blades. More advanced issues and technical details will be touched upon in follow-up articles. Simply explained, Damascus blades are basically made of several pieces of steel, each with a different metallurgical composition. Stacked together, these layers of steel is called a pile. The pile is composed of five or more pieces of steel, stacked one on top of the other, bound together by metal wire, and forge welded and manipulated to create a pattern, hence the term “pattern welding”. As one prepares to forge the blade, the pattern and tone will be created by the different metallurgical content contained in the alloy of the stack. As a general guideline, when forging a Damascus steel blade, Manganese will produce a dark/bl`,

    content: `The Evolution Of the Medieval Sword In the 13th - 15th Centuries Sword design in the late medieval period evolved in direct response to rapid growth of the armor of the late medieval era. Hence, the understanding as to how, and why, medieval swords evolved as they did, is intertwined with an understanding of the changes in armor production during the later part of the Middle Ages. As the arsenal of medieval weapons improved, so did the armor. The evolution of armor came as a direct response to the ever improving blade geometry of the late medieval sword. Compounded to this threat, was the ever growing arsenal of armor piercing weapons. As armor improved, the design and function of medieval weapons, in turn, improved and developed, making it easier to penetrate the complex armor of the late 15th century. This dual relationship, between both sword design and armor construction is referred to by some historians as the "arms race" of the late medieval period. The high Middle Ages is the period between the early 13th and the 15th century. During this 300 year span, armor changed more dramatically and more rapidly than it had in the previous millennium. Prior to the 13th century, the primary armor was chain mail; a suit made of small interlocking rings of steel. Providing exceptional movement and a well distributed weight pattern. Chain mail was quite effective in countering slashes and cuts afflicted by the swords leading up to the zenith of the 13th century, (particularly of type`,

    content: `Recently, Eyal Azerad, the owner of Darksword Armory, took a first-hand examination of an authentic pair of 16th century German Gauntlets. The Gauntlets are dated from 1580-1590’s. Made of Iron. Rolled and roped edge cuffs, five slightly tapered and embossed metacarpal plates and shaped knuckle plates. Finely etched with continuous floral design on the central band and upper borders. These present one of the nicest pair of Gauntlets we have inspected in the last couple of years. Interestingly enough, the floral designs etched on the German Gauntlets are almost identical to an Italian model of the same period (16th century). This close similarity points to a clear trend in fashion and artistic creativity during the end of the 15th century and extending well into the 16th. Similar floral patterns were not only found on leg armor, breastplates, gauntlets and helmets, but also on wax seals, woodcuts and architectural structures. Previous to 1400 A.D. floral designs seems to have been limited to Persian paintings, rugs and tapestries of the fourteenth century. Armors of Medieval Europe seldom displayed similar trends in terms of design. By the 15th Century, an artistic revival in Greek and Roman styles emerged. Blacksmiths began etching foliage on various parts of the armors. Olive vines, roses, ivies and laurels were often etched on breastplates, pauldrons and arm harness, descending to the gauntlets. This revival or revised interest in the arts began during the Trecento, a stron`,

    content: `The expression ‘throwing down the gauntlet’ stems from the middle ages and is literally a call to arms. One look at the medieval gauntlet, often featuring knuckledusters design to maximize punishment when resorting to punches, and it’s easy to understand how the gauntlet became a symbolic call to arms. Early metal plate hand protection began during the late 12th century when the mail sleeves of the hauberk were elongated into a mitten. Worn above a leather glove, mail armor protected the fingers, along with a single armor plate. This pattern of armored hand protection was worn until the end of the 13th century. By the early 14th century, mail gloves with separate fingers started to appear as an extension of the sleeve plates. These extensions covered the backside of the hand, offering greater protection, from the wrist to the end of the metacarpals. Bordered by the thumb joint, embossed around the finger joints and base of the thumb, the design included overlapping plates that covered the individual fingers and cuff. In their earlier forms, these armoured gloves were known as hourglass gauntlets due to the widening plated geometry over the back of the hand, which narrowed at the wrist and flared at the cuff. Generally, only the thumb was articulated with mechanical plates while the fingers were protected by a solid top plate, riveted to mail or leather gloves. This type of armour remained in vogue until the fifteenth century, when the cuff narrowed to protect against the thre`,

Not only was it the last battle in the “Wars of the Roses" but it was also a major historical point as it was the last time a reigning monarch, in this instance Richard III, went into battle for his country. On February 4th 2013, it was revealed that the bones discovered buried under a car park in Leicester city centre in August last year are actually those of Richard III. Background to the wars The roots of the Wars of the Roses lay much further back than many people assume, for while the actual series of battles commenced around the year 1455, the beginnings of unrest start around the death of King Edward III and the power play that formed between his sons who were all anxious to rule. Edward III’s eldest son, the Black Prince, Edward had predeceased him by just a year and so the crown automatically passed to his grandson, the then ten year old Richard II. However, as was customary for the time and because of his tender years, Richard’s uncle and the Black Prince’s brother, John of Gaunt ruled in his name. As Richard entered his teens he became increasingly embittered about the way in which John was ruling and started to rebel against the decisions he made. Richard’s own style of governance, was however, deemed unsuitable by most of the upper echelons of the ruling elite. After John of Gaunt’s death in 1399, Richard confiscated his lands.

    content: `So the box has just arrived, and inside is your brand new sword. Perhaps you're planning to put it on your wall, or use it for cutting practice. Regardless of what you're planning to do, we have compiled a short list of things you can do and things that you should avoid doing with your sword. Proper use of a Medieval Sword What you should do: 1. Keep the sword's blade oiled and stored in a temperature controlled space. As odd as it may seem, a sword is a relatively delicate piece of equipment. Condensation on the blade caused by temperature changes, and even a fingerprint from the oils from your fingers, can cause it to rust. The best way to protect it is to keep moisture and fingerprints from settling on it, and wipe it down with an oily cloth. The oil is easy to find - mineral oil from a drugstore will do nicely, and since a blade requires relatively little of it for a micro-thin layer, one bottle will last you a very long time. Temperature control is also important. Too much variation in the temperature can damage the fittings of your sword, as changes in heat can cause the wood of the grip to expand and contract, possibly cracking it. The sword should never be stored inside it's scabbard for an extended period (2 weeks +). The leather will tramp condensation. This will eventually form rust on your blade if stored in the scabbard. 2. Using your sword for cutting tests Most of the swords made by Darksword - and almost everybody else - are made with functionality in mind. Da`,

    slug: "how-sharp-were-medieval-swords",
    content: `An analysis of edge sharpness during the middle ages It is one of those devilish questions that can confound people even today: how sharp was a Medieval sword? The problem lies with the question – there is an underlying assumption that when it comes to how they are used, Medieval swords can be generalized into a single category. This belief is erroneous. The reality was that from the very beginning, the form and function of Medieval swords was fluid and in constant development. The “longsword” of the 15th century judicial duel, which was a cut-and-thrust weapon designed for unarmoured combat, was very different from the “longsword” of the 14th century knight, which was a thrusting weapon built to puncture plate armour. Indeed, it would be accurate to say that a full-out arms race existed between bladesmiths and armourers in the Middle Ages, with armour developing to counter the latest weaponry, and bladesmiths modifying their swords to match. This is one of the reasons that when talking about Medieval swords, it is best to use Oakeshott’s Typology – with no fewer than 22 different categories of sword blade in use from 1000 to 1500, it is far more useful in understanding how swords developed and how they were used. The Oakeshott typology is particularly useful as, particularly in the early Middle Ages, it is next to impossible to determine the original sharpness of the sword through surviving examples. Swords used in battle survive primarily as archaeological finds, with the e`,

It should first be noted however, that this blog article is written specifically for the maintenance of High Carbon Steel European swords. These guidelines should not be applied to Damascus steel swords or Katanas (Samurai Swords ). Sword maintenance is not complicated. Cleaning your sword blade and fittings twice a year will suffice. This process takes 5 to 10 minutes and does not require any machinery. This article is an easy to follow guide for the proper maintenance of your sword. Proper Care of Your Sword Maintenance: 5 simple Tips 1- When it comes to swords, humidity plays a crucial factor. Ideally, you should store or display your sword collection in an environment that has about 30% humidity level to avoid rust or corrosion. 2- Avoid skin to blade contact. Such contact will leave oil and salt that will eventually corrode the blade. 3- Do not store your sword in its scabbard for extended periods (30 days or more). Scabbards are made of wood, wrapped in leather. The leather will trap moisture and will eventually corrode the blade if it is left in the scabbard for extended periods. 4- Clean your sword blade and fittings every 6 months if you are simply displaying your sword. 5- Clean and oil yo`,

    content: `The Myth of Chivalry by : Dave Jaehning / Darksword Armory inc. The idea of chivalry – the knight in shining armor defending God, king, and country with sword and flawless character – is not a new one. In fact, it can trace its roots back to the High Middle Ages and Early Modern Europe, to a literary genre called Chivalric Romance. The genre consisted of near fantasy stories about hair-raising adventures, often of a knight errant depicted as having heroic qualities, who goes off on a gallant quest. These stories involved an emphasis on courtly manners and tales of love. Originally written in Old French, Anglo Norman, and Occitan, Chivalric Romance was later translated and written in English and German. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a definite tendency to emphasize themes based on courtly love, such as faithfulness in the face of adversity. Historical record, however, paints a very different picture. It reveals knights as ruthless, enforcers of the wills of equally ruthless lords and kings. For example, Roger of Hovedon, in his Chronica, for the year 1165, recorded: After these things, Henry, king of England, returned from Normandy to England, and marched with a great army into Wales … he did justice upon the sons of Rees, and upon the sons and daughters of his nobles, for he had the eyes of the male children put out, and cut off the noses and ears of the females. In the 11th and 12th centuries, knights were the sons of wealthy landowners who`,

Although at the time that it was written it was not intended to be, the Magna Carta has become the most celebrated and significant historical and political document that ever issued from England. John, King of England, was the youngest of five sons born to Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. As king when war broke out with France in 1202, John initially won early victories. Shortages in military resources, however, along with his brutal treatment of the nobles of Norman, Breton, and Anjou, resulted in his losing his holdings in northern France in 1204. John spent much of the next ten years preparing for another invasion of France, but he would not get the support of his barons. The barons were against involvement on the continent and were against another incursion into France. Undeterred, John continued to raise funds, raise armies, and secure mercenaries from France, using whatever means he could to secure the revenue he needed for the next phase of the war. In 1205, John found himself in an argument with Pope Innocent III over who should be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. The Pope wanted Stephan Langton appointed, but John swore Langton would never enter England. In 1209, the Pope excommunicated John and banned Masses in all parish churches, which John then used as an excuse to confiscate church properties, and then sell them back to the bishops at a profit.

Pulling the hard flat object from the river, the boy inspected his find and decided to casually walk home to show the sword to his father. Knowing little of swords, the father called the Gaoyou Cultural Relies Bureau, who after numerous tests, determined that the sword was made during the Bronze Age during the Shang or Zhou dynastic period, 3000 years ago. The Shang dynasty existed between1600 to 1050 BCE and were well known for being the first in producing bronze in large quantities. While confirming the 3000 year old estimate provided by the Gaoyou Cultural Relics Bureau, Mr. Lya Zhiwei, declared that the sword was used as a symbolic tool of authority, rather than a weapon. The dating of the artifact, locked the sword as originating just prior to the rise of Chinese civilization. The Laozuhlin River, where the ancient sword was found, was an active trade center since 486 BC. Today, the River is known as the Grand Canal. Since the 11 year Old’s finding, archaeologists have started extensive searches to uncover other archaeological artifacts. Yang Junxi, the young boy who found the sword, was eventually rewarded an undisclosed amount and given a certificate for “donating the historical artifact”.`,

    content: `Game of Thrones has long been a household name among fans and medieval ‘film’ buffs. The show however has gained such grand following that the name resonates even among those who have never watched a season, an episode, a bloody battle scene or let alone a trailer. In the midst of the tremendously popular HBO show, a cult following has emerged, collecting various paraphernalia ranging from Game of thrones mugs, clothing, books, posters, banners, and among true diehard fans, even swords and Armors. Loyal fans to, arguably the most popular show in the last decade, flock to the game of thrones exhibits, anxiously waiting to sit on the Iron Throne, examine the swords, weapons, shield and armours worn by Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Tyrion & Jaimie Lannister, Jorah Mormont, Brienne of Tarth, and of course, everyone most hated character: Joffrey Baratheon. Game of Thrones has gained such ground in both television and popular culture that a Canadian university (university of British Columbia) has devoted an entire course to study of Game of Thrones. Entitled Our Modern Medieval: The Song of Ice and Fire as contemporary Medievalism; the course studies the impact of the show on our modern perception of the middle ages. Students are required to read the Song of Ice and Fire series in its entirety and watch the entire HBO production of Games of Thrones (5 seasons so far). According to Professor Robert Rouse, depictions of medieval times like those found in Martin’s novels “have largely supplan`,

    content: `By Alen Lovrič NOTE: In this short article, geographical and political factors were largely ignored for the sake of brevity. Some regions developed metallurgy sooner and some later, but that is a broad topic in its own right. It is not uncommon to hear people claim that there is some sort of a super-material for swords. A material which makes them better, stronger, sharper. The idea pops up every so often in various media, be it games, movies, TV series or books. Anyone who knows the basics of what a sword should be realizes that this is nonsense. After all, if such a material existed, modern-day smiths would be sure to use it. There's only one little catch: it is real, and they are using it. Weapons were made from different materials at different eras; often, this can be seen in the name of the age in question: Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age... And through these millenia, people were always ready and willing to accept new, better materials for their weapons. Switching to a new material was a very slow process, however – the first swords according to archeological data go as far back as 1700 BC for bronze swords, and some even argue for 3300 BC for the copper sword-daggers. Swords which can be said to come close to the quality of edged weaponry we make today were only produced in the 16th century. In the course of almost five millenias, humanity has found the ultimate material – THE material, which makes swords better, stronger and sharper: steel. So why did it take so long?`,

    content: `By Eyal Azerad During the early Middle Ages, the primary metal available for the manufacture of swords was derived from bloomery iron, made by heating iron ore with charcoal in small furnaces. While sufficient for some applications, the finished iron was plagued with slag inclusions that weakened the metal, rendering a sword blade that was prone to break when struck with force against a hard object, such as a shield or another sword. Quantitative analysis of early Viking swords revealed that the carbon content of the blades was very low when compared to later steels. Three pattern welded blades from Norway were analyzed: their carbon content ranged from 0.401 percent carbon, to 0.520 percent carbon. This is the typical carbon content of swords of the period from all over Europe and Scandinavia. When considering the low carbon content of the steel, combined with the typical amount of slag inclusions in early medieval steel, the result was an excessively soft blade prone to breakage and damage at a time when his life depended on the quality of his sword. One sword stood out among all others during the time, however: a Viking Sword that is known as the Ulfberht. While medieval steel was weak, containing particles of slag, the steel of the Ulfberht swords was different : Ulfberht – a superior steel that could not be replicated until well into the 1880s during the Industrial Revolution. The Ulfberht swords were made of crucible steel, which was not at all common during the Middle `,

    content: `By Eyal Azerad Simply stated, swords are made of many different types of metals, the most prevailing being steel. Although a proper steel is required for creating a high quality sword, many technical considerations, such as how the steel was prepared and processed, should also be factored. The following article will examine the most common blade materials used for the manufacture of European blades as it relates to the modern day sword industry and enucleate their merits and shortcomings. In the lower spectrum are stainless steel swords; they are shiny, impervious to rust or corrosion and require minimal maintenance. Unfortunately however, they are also very brittle. These types of swords make for nice decorative pieces, but are not intended, nor are they adequate, for actual use. Stainless steel has a high content of chromium, often over 11 percent. Chromium is used as a grain enhancer and gives the steel it’s stainless properties. When a stainless steel blade is placed under tension, the molecular grain boundaries between the chromium and the steel begins to weaken. This in turn produces stress points causing the sword blade to become weak and brittle. A superior sword blade material compared to that of stainless is carbon steel. Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron, carbon, and smaller amounts of other trace elements that are often present. Iron is the major component of steel but the amount of carbon added to the iron will determine significantly to the properties `,

    content: `By John Clements There is a truth to this modern-day study of swords that eludes many students and enthusiasts. It is a simple fact that virtually no one ever gets to use a quality sharp blade full force on realistic target materials. That is, to cut, cleave, chop, hack, slice, and slash against portions of raw meat and bone positioned to simulate a historical encounter. For that matter, few get to experiment by striking in this way at accurate reconstructions of various hard and soft armors, either. So, even as efforts are made to have the most accurate replica blades and exercise with them in the most genuine manner possible using a sound understanding of authentic techniques and movements, in terms of the actual results that such violent motions would have produced there is arguably much that is missed. Just how it is that sword blades of different shapes and widths, different cross-sectional geometries and edge-bevels, and different weights and curvatures intertwine such elements to produce different traumatic effects in close combat is still a huge unknown. Ironically, insight into some of these lessons can be gained from the most unexpected of places with which nearly everyone has some ordinary experience: your kitchen. If we compare different kinds of swords to the different kinds of knives one might commonly find in a typical kitchen, the reasons why there are so many variations and kinds of swords becomes clearer. In a modern kitchen you will find many types of knive`,

    content: `Debunking the Myth of the Medieval Sword When it comes to the study of the Medieval sword, Ewart Oakeshott ( 25 may 1916- 30th September 2002) was arguably the man who did more than any other to bring the study of arms and armour into the 20th century as a serious field of study. Prior to Ewart Oakeshott’s 1960 seminal book, The Archaeology of Weapons, the perception of the Medieval sword was more myth than reality. The sword was considered a clumsy weapon, little more than a sharpened crowbar incapable of finesse or technique that could easily weigh 15 lbs. It was a myth so prevalent that T.H. White, in The Once and Future King, wrote a scene in which Sir Lancelot was practising with a 30 lb. sword so that his 15 lb. sword would feel lighter. The scholarly attitude towards arms and armour was very dismissive. The sword, they felt, was a clumsy weapon, and therefore not worthy of any note or serious study. Those who did cover the subject, such as Charles Ffoulkes in 1938, made claims such as: “The so-called ‘Crusader’ sword is heavy, broad-bladed, and short gripped. There is no balance, as the word is understood in swordsmanship, and to thrust with it is an impossibility – its weight made swift recovery impossible.” This did not mean that there were no scholars on the fringe who tried to provide the sword – and the field of arms and armor itself – with serious study. Oakeshott was neither the first, nor would he be the last. Those who did, however, found themselves in a nasce`,

    content: `Tracking the Medieval Arms Race Ewart Oakeshott’s (1916-2002) typology is far more than just a means for cataloguing variations on the Medieval sword. It also tells a story – a chronicle of an arms race centuries ago that pitted armorers against bladesmiths in an ongoing battle to push military technology to its limits. One cannot truly understand the development of swords without understanding the arms race – no sword was ever developed in a vacuum. The swords of the Middle Ages were precision weapons, built to function on a battlefield against the armor of its day, and defeat it. As development in armor made one type of sword blade obsolete, bladesmiths would make another to take its place. Oakeshott’s typology is a journey through time and the history of Medieval warfare, from the Viking Age to the Renaissance, from raiders to armored knights to the sword masters whose work still inspires historical fencers today. And it all begins as the age of longships faded away and a new feudal order emerged. The Rise of the Age of Chivalry The first period of Oakeshott’s typology began in the wake of a technological revolution that began in Germany. Beginning most likely with the Ulfberht forge – the 10th century equivalent of a sword factory or firm – bladesmiths discovered how to refine steel to the point that they could make a blade out of a single bar, rather than having to use the time consuming (albeit beautiful) process of pattern welding. The Ulfberht forge even created sword`,

    content: `Filling in the Blanks Ewart Oakeshott’s typology may be one of the most useful tools in documenting and understanding the Medieval arms race, but it is far from a complete picture of the development of the Medieval sword. In order to complete one’s picture of the sword, one must also look at the hilts of the sword, and even the decoration of the blade. Oakeshott recognized this, and his work not only covered his typology, but also linked the swords in it to blade inscriptions and hilt forms. The Military Relic The knightly sword was far more than just a weapon to the Medieval knight. It was also a religious object, a personal sanctified cross that the knight would carry into battle. And, its blade decorations reflect this. Inlays on blades were nothing new in the 12th century. For centuries before, the Ulfberht and Ingelrii sword firms had been marking their products with their names inlayed along the fuller, as had other smiths. In the 11th century, the type X swords began to show a distinction in their decoration – while one side of the sword still bears the maker’s name, the other was inlayed with a religious inscription. The most common was “INNOMINEDOMINI” (“In the name of God”), although this is often misspelled. There were also variations – a type X sword in Dresden has an Ingelrii inlay on one side, and on the other, in small neat letters, the words “HOMODEI” (“Man of God”), which Oakeshott suggests means that the sword was made for a crusader.

From their place on the battlefield to their role in the romanticised depiction of knighthood and chivalry, even people who have no interest in collecting sword for themselves will know one if they see one. Works of art, history books, trips to the museum – you almost couldn’t avoid them if you tried. And because of how frequently they appear as we learn about history there are certain types of swords that have become more iconic, more recognisable, to the average person. We at Darksword Armory have always been history buffs, history fans, perhaps even history “geeks” if that fits. Conversation about favorite swords from history happens too often to count around here, so we thought we’d compile some of our favorite, most recognizable swords from history for you to enjoy. Viking Swords Thanks to depictions in popular culture, Vikings are the subject of much misinformation. Historians and Viking-enthusiasts alike can be reduced to (manly) tears when they see pictures of filthy, unkempt Vikings with horned helmets. However, despite the fact that Vikings used a wide variety of weapons the iconic Viking sword is absolutely historical, and many surviving examples of it exist for historians to examine. The Viking Sword developed from early straight blades like the Roman Spatha, as did many European swords of that and later ages. It was a double edged, single handed blade with a wide fuller, a short handle, and simple guard, and often ha`,

For those of us who lack access to a time machine, though, there is the Leeds Royal Armouries Museum. Since 1996 the Leeds Royal Armouries Museum has housed the United Kingdom’s National Collection of Arms and Armour, which was previously held at the Tower of London. Originally, the Office of the Royal Armoury was commissioned centuries ago to manufacturer medieval weapons and armour for the British royal family and their soldiers. Based out of the Tower of London, also known as “The White Tower,” it grew to become a repository of arms and armour; essentially, it was the first museum in the United Kingdom. As firearms slowly replaced the edged weapons of the British foot soldiers, the National Collection was gradually placed into storage, with only a fraction of it left on display at the Tower of London. In 1935 the Royal Armouries was recognised as a national museum, and slowly the collection re-entered the public eye. This world-renowned collection hosts more than 70,000 articles of weapons and armor dating from ancient times (pre-Roman) to the modern era in several locations, none of which is as impressive as the Royal Armouries in Leeds, West Yorkshire, UK.

Specifically, we take a look at the overthrow of the Dark Lord Morgoth, the fate of the half-elves, and the founding of the ancient kingdom of Númenor - and what connection this kingdom has to a popular character from the books. Aragorn, titular hero from The Return of the King and one of the central characters of the Lord of the Rings series, is often referred to as the heir of Gondor. If you're like most fans of the Lord of the Rings books you've always just taken this at face value - there is a kingdom named Gondor, and Aragorn is the rightful ruler of that kingdom. Simple enough, yes? However, the deeper you go into the story, the more complicated the situation gets. For example, we also hear about how Aragorn is the rightful king of a country called Arnor - what's that about? And what's this "Númenor" place that people keep talking about? In order to answer these questions, we welcome you to a Lord of the Rings history blog post - The Rise and Fall of Númenor (Part 1). Tolkien did nothing halfway, and nowhere is that more apparent than in his world of Middle-Earth. He wrote voluminous amounts of history and myth that were gathered into the text of Middle-Earth lore known as "The Silmarillion."

The Isle sat in the ocean off the West coast of Middle-Earth yet not so far to the West as to be close to Valinor, the Undying Lands, home of the Valar and the place to which all elves would eventually be gathered. Led by Elros the half-elf, the faithful humans sailed to Elenna and founded a kingdom which they called Númenor. This kingdom they established became mighty among the realms of Middle-Earth – to quote from the previous blog post: For a long, long time Númenor was a beacon of light and culture in Middle-Earth. Their long life let them grow in power, and their kingdom became ever more majestic. Their great ships sailed all the oceans of Middle-Earth, visiting strange lands and making alliances with the people they found there. However, they paid attention to the one law the Valar gave them, a law known as the Ban - that they never attempt to sail to Valinor and set foot on the Undying Lands. And for many generations, they were content. Due to the half-elven nature of Elros, he was granted long life – living and ruling for centuries.

From March to August 2016, an isolated number of swords were discovered to have poor quality tangs. In most of these cases, the tang issue was revealed when customers altered the product, removing the grip. The tangs in these swords were much too narrow. To correct this issue, Darksword had the swords with defective tangs returned as soon as possible to be tested. At first, we were skeptical as this was coming from an individual “maker” who is technically a competitor. But after verification we determined that the assembly did not meet our standards of production. That said, the tangs were inadequate; the tangs were ground down to fit in the throat of the grips. This went against Darksword’s proven production technique, which is to individually craft the grips to fit each tang. The incorrect technique was utilized by two of Darksword’s staff without approval. The staff members responsible were dismissed following the incident. “Upon investigation, we discovered two of our assembly staff had been grinding down some of the tangs to fit `,

    content: `In stories from legend and antiquity, swords have a special place. From Hrunting, the sword of Beowulf, to Excalibur, sword of King Arthur, they are the centerpieces of countless myths. Because of the high regard in which swords are held, bladesmithing – the process of creating a sword – has long been regarded with fascination and awe, as if it was an almost magical process. Historical sources describe those makers of legendary swords with reverence, glorifying their skill and attributing to them sometimes mystical abilities. This has led in modern times to an overall fascination with bladesmithing that is, unfortunately, divorced from any practical knowledge of the craft – resulting in confusion about what the process actually entails. Pop culture has contributed to this confusion as television and films often depict the process of sword making with wild inaccuracies. Consider the opening scenes of Conan the Barbarian (1982) in which a steel sword is poured into a mould, a process reserved for softer metals such as bronze. How many sword collectors based their understanding of bladesmithing on that scene? Beyond the folklore and mysticism, beyond the films and television shows, the process of sword making, while indeed complex, is not arcane in nature. Collectors and fans of swords both historical and legendary have long been fascinated with the process of making a sword. To respond to this curiosity, we wanted to answer some of the more common questions we receive from our `,

    content: `Around the World – The Incredible Journey of the Urnes Staves Sword Part of our focus at Darksword Armory is on continuous improvement. By that, we mean we are constantly striving to do better than we have before. We were very proud of the swords we produced 20 years ago, but they are unrecognizable next to our latest line! In 2018, we decided to reach out to YouTube sword reviewer Skallagrim to review the latest in our long line of Viking weapons – the Urnes Staves sword. SKallagrim being a well-known and honest reviewer, and a fellow Canadian (living at the opposite end of the country from us in British Columbia) we figured he would be an excellent person to put our prototype through its paces. And put it through its paces he did! When Skallagrim reviews a sword, he does not pull any punches. The following two videos are the result of Skallagrim giving our prototype a serious review. Once the review videos were posted, we experienced the usual increase in web traffic and online questions about our products, and the Urnes Staves sword proved to be a popular design. We didn’t ask Skallagrim to return the sword, so when he passed it on to a collector in Australia we thought nothing of it. And so, the sword passed into other hands, and we never expected to hear about it again… And then, not too long ago, we got a big surprise! Sword collector Philippe Goulet reached out to tell us he was the newest owner of a secondhand Urnes Staves sword, and had some questions about it compar`,
